#  The Upgraded Version: D-LADAN meets Transformers
To fairly compare with the related works involving the pre-train language mode(PLM) backbones, such as BERT, Lawformer, etc, we propose a Transformer version of LADAN and D-LADAN to verify the effectiveness of the model strategy.

## Introduction
We constructed a Transformer version of D-LADAN and LADAN based on the **Pytorch** and built this project here.
