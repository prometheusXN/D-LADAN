# D-LADAN (under construction) 
The source code of article "**Distinguish Confusion in Legal Judgment Prediction via Revised Relation Knowledge of Law Articles**" in TOIS, which is the revised journal version of article ''*Distinguish Confusing Law Articles for Legal Judgment Prediction*'', ACL 2020.

In this version, we consider the **confusing law article (or charge) problem** from both prior and posterior perspectives.
Through the analysis of the problem, we conflate the posterior confusing law article (or charge) problem and the data imbalance problem together and make further improvements to our conference model, [LADAN](https://github.com/prometheusXN/LADAN).

Compared with *LADAN*, our main improvement in this work is the proposed **revised memory mechanism**, which senses the posterior similarity relationships between law articles (or charges)

## Introduction
We refactored [LADAN](https://github.com/prometheusXN/LADAN) based on the **Tensorflow2.x**, and built this project.

## Data Processing

## Usage
Basic requirements for all the libraries are in the `requirements.txt`.
