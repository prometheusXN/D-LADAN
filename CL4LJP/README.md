Our implementation of the pytorch version of paper "**Contrastive Learning for Legal Judgment Prediction.**", TOIS 2023.

## usage
Call the "**train_\*.py**" to train the CL4LJP model on variout datasets.

For training, you should generate the processed data form by the codes named "__\*\_generator.py__" and put them in the "__processed_data__" folder.

You can also download our processed data from our Google Drive: [**processed data (for CL4LJP)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-RWqJxCW_agYzb-TFA2l2iB2SNfE4fR9/view?usp=share_link)
